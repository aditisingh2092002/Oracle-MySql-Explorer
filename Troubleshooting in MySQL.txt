Troubleshooting in MySQL:--

	#There are three components of these messages.
		1.) A MySQL-specific code.
		2.) An SQL state error code, which is defined by standard SQL and ODBC.
		3.) A text message there describes the problem.
	
	#Many MySQL statements generate warnings and errors. These are not always displayed by default. There are statements we can use to show error and warning output.

	#Troubleshooting Message Options:-

		**Statements control isplay of errors and warnings:
			--> SHOW WARNINGS:- Displays error, warning, and informational messages generated by last statement.
			--> SHOW ERRORS:- Displays error message only.
		**Refer to the error code definitions in the "MySQL Reference manual";
		**After understanding the cause of the error/warning, make changes and run the SQL statement again.
 	
	#Use the MySQL Reference Manual to look up the meanings of error codes and get help for common problems.
